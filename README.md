#How to use
To install clone the repo, navigate inside, then type 'yarn start'.
When the QR code appears, install the 'Expo' app on your device, then scan the code.

#Snack for Online Viewing:
Have just tried to upload to Snack, but Snack has issues downloading the modules of the latest version of Redux Saga.

# Todo
Test on Android (Should work, all styling is relative and doesnt use padding)
Make delays in request to server (so it feels more like facebook loading)
Make article button do something. "Perhaps link to original article?"
