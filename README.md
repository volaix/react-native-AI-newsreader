## How to use
* To use, clone the repo, navigate inside, then type 'yarn start'.
* When the QR code appears, install the 'Expo' app on your device, then scan the code.

## Snack for Online Viewing:
Have just tried to upload to Snack, but Snack has issues downloading the modules of the latest version of Redux Saga.

# Todo
* Test on Android (Should work, all styling is relative and doesnt use padding)
* Make delays in request to server (so it feels more like facebook loading)
* Make article button do something. "Perhaps link to original article?"
